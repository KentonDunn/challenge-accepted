a random date night generator

Possible APIs for use:
-Open Table
-Google Maps
-Fandango
-Eventful
-Meetup
-Openweather?

-The idea is that you give the app a list of things you think you could fit into a date, and it will select one event or location for each topic within a specified proximity of each other.

-User logs in. They select a geographic area (current location or zip code). Make decisions regarding the kind of activities they are interested in. Once they confirm their choices, the app returns a map with options for each of their activities within a specified proximity of each other.

-One user creates a date suggestion, sends to another user, and they confirm or send back alternatives.
